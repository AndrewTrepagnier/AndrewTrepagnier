🎭🎭⚜️⚜️

**My name is Andrew and I'm an engineer at ExxonMobil**

I have all sorts of interest: computational materials science, programming languages, predicting stuff, and various first-principles mechanical engineering calculations.
  
I typically build stuff that help me in my day-to-day or just for fun.
