🎭🎭⚜️⚜️

**My name is Andrew and I'm a Mechanical Integrity Engineer for ExxonMobil. My interest is in developing open source scientific computing packages.**
  
The majority of my experience comes from computational materials science research, but I enjoy studying and building other things as well.
